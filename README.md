# oprev
Sample of JAVA+XML XSLT transformation codes. This code is reach beacuse it unite: A strong Markup Language Knowledge with Specitification in XSD file, Transformation algorithym in XSL file, it use within a JSP taglib specific implementation in Java.


## Welcome to my github samples code - oprev

oprev was the acronymn for Odontoprev an important teeth health care enterprise in Brazil.
This is an important example of an implementation of CMS (Content Management System) made by a XSLT Transformation that I've coded in 2003.

I've just picked some files that shows up this implementantion which envolves JAVA+XML, see as follows:

1. XSLTransform.java - A Java implementation of XSLT Mechanism which invokes an .xsl file within a java context;
2. website.xsd - The Schema Specification for marlup elements used in xsl transformation.
3. suaconta.jsp - The JSP with XSL instruction into the code implemented using jstl library.
4. vitrine.jsp - The JSP which call the XSLTransForm above in an specific owned taglib.
5. left-area.xml - XML files using specific markups defined in website.xsd.


This kind of mecanism (XSLT Transformation) was used further in other projects not only in java, with xsl files in Peugeot website in 2004 and directly in VBA code in MSAccess in Unibanco in 2006 working with geo processed .kml files in google Earth.
